        <p class="text-center">I am a family man who has recently rekindled a desire to create a career in software development and
          I am now looking to take the next step in my passion for a new career. 
          I pride myself on always aiming to do the best job I can. I work well with others and I am always committed to tasks I undertake. 
          Currently as a mature student I feel that I am in a very unique position, where my choice and enthusiasm to learn is based on life experience and
            a strong passion for software development. I am currently en-rolled on the Code: Cumbria boot camp course, 
            as well as using resources such as Codecademy, Udemy, YouTube, Stack Overflow, Microsoft documentation and community groups mainly on Discord, 
            to research and further my education </p>

            <h4 class="text-lg font-medium">CF Tracker</h4>
          </a>
          <p>- C#, HTML, CSS, MVC, Entity Framework</p>
          <p>I started this project because as a Cystic Fibrosis out patient, I have no consistent and easy way to record and track key results. 
            This web application simply requires a user to login with an email and password, 
            create a user profile, then users can record key results. 
            The results can then be viewed in a graph and list format. For this project I used MVC, 
            for the experience and to better understand how the framework works.</p>

          </a>
          <p>- C#, HTML, CSS, Blazor, Azure Tables</p>
          <p>I created this project to practice .NET Blazor web assembly, HTML, CSS and Azure table storage. 
            I used the idea of a website to promote and view the hand"made earrings my wife makes and sells at craft fares. 
            I used the Blazor framework which accesses an Azure table storage via 
            HTTP requests to a Web API which I also created.</p>

          </a>
          <p>- C#, .NET Web API, Azure Tables</p>
          <p>When creating the Emily Lily Website I decided to also create a web API to retrieve product information from an Azure table storage. 
            I later added to this API so it also handled the contact form messages from the website. 
            For this project I used the ASP.NET Core Web API framework, Azure table storage and the MailKit package. 
            I also used my basic knowledge of Postman to test the API.</p>

          <p>- NET Blazor, xUnit</p>
          <p>I started this project to practice using dependency injection via interfaces and unit testing (using the xUnit nuget package). 
            The application has two pages, one for a very basic “To Do” list and the other page for another “To Do” list 
            with a way to set the current progress on each task.</p>

          <p>After completing the Codecademy HTML and CSS beginners courses I wanted to practice using these, 
            so decided to recreate my guest house website. I used .NET Blazor framework as the base project.</p>
